# Overview
This repository contains a C++ keylogging prototype designed for educational purposes only. It demonstrates the use of low-level hooks to capture keystrokes on Windows systems. Please note that this project is intended solely for learning and understanding cybersecurity concepts. Any misuse of this code for malicious activities is strictly prohibited and against the law.
# Current Status

- Windows (WIN32): The logWin32.cpp file is functional and can be used to test the keylogging prototype on Windows systems.
- Debian-based Machines: The logdeb.cpp file is still under construction and not yet operational. Development is ongoing.

# Important Disclaimer
This tool is provided for educational purposes only. It should not be used to violate privacy, engage in unauthorized surveillance, or any illegal activities. Always obtain explicit permission before testing on any system, and ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.
# Installation and Usage
## For Windows (WIN32)

Clone the repository:
```
textgit clone https://github.com/PiezoGo/K3ylogg3r.git
```
Compile the logWin32.cpp file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++ or Visual Studio).
Run the compiled executable to start capturing keystrokes.

Note: This is a prototype and may not work perfectly. Use at your own risk for educational testing.
## For Debian-based Machines
This feature is under construction. Check back for updates.
# Contributing
Contributions are welcome for educational enhancements. Please ensure all changes align with the learning-focused goal of this project.
